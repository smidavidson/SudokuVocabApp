# Build

For best results please run this program on newer devices with newer versions of Android (API Level > 30). Although you may install this app on any device with an Android version above API Level > 22, you might not see the best views of different pages of the application (buttons and views may go out of screen bound or due to toolbar taking varied sizes, other parts of screen break). This is a work in progress and soon we will add support for any screen size!
